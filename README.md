## Playlist Moodboard (Spotify Web API) — WIP

## About
I plan to build a lightweight web app that lets users explore Spotify playlists in a more visual way.  
The main idea is to paste a playlist link/ID and display it as a “moodboard” using cover art + track details, and then (optionally) add simple audio-feature insights.

I enjoy Spotify and I also enjoy experimenting with creative coding and UI, so this is a project where I can combine both.  
I’m building the MVP first (clean UI + playlist fetch), then I’ll improve it step by step.

## Planned features
- Paste a Spotify playlist link/ID
- Show playlist cover + title + basic info
- Display tracklist (first 10–50 tracks)
- Audio feature insights (energy, valence, danceability)
- Simple charts / visual summaries

## Tech stack (planned)
- Vite
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Spotify Web API

## Status
Work in progress 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Setting up project structure + basic UI
- [ ] Adding Spotify authentication (PKCE)
