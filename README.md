# Playlist Moodboard (Spotify Web API) — WIP

## About
I plan to build a lightweight web app that lets users explore Spotify playlists in a more visual way.  
The main goal is to take a playlist and display it as a “moodboard” using cover art + track details, and then (optionally) add simple audio-feature insights.

I enjoy Spotify and I also enjoy experimenting with creative coding and UI, so this is a project where I can combine both.  
I’m building the MVP first (clean UI + playlist fetch), then I’ll improve it step by step.
